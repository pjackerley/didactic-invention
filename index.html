        </h3>
        <p>
            Educated, motivated and conscientious, great with people and a skilled communicator, I am now looking for new and further opportunities to utilise my skills and abilities in IT and coding after twenty years of teaching. I get great satisfaction from using and developing my technical skills, helping people, organising and problem solving.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                At the beginning of 2022, my father was in hospital with rapidly worsening Lewy bodies dementia, too ill to be returned to his care home but not ill enough to stay in hospital. My mother, who had been in charge of managing his care, died as a result of a car accident. Whilst grieving for her, I also had to liaise with the police about the accident, arrange the funeral, and take charge of my father's care by dealing with social services, hospitals, care homes and the local council, remembering that my dad's health and wellbeing were paramount. Dad was successfully transferred to a new nursing home, unaware of the problems behind the scenes, and Mum's funeral took place at the same time.

            <br />
            <li>
                Whilst working as a teacher, I was approached by one of my student's parents, deeply concerned about her progress and the attitude the school was taking about it. I had to take charge of the situation and deal with his complaints, talk to staff about the student's progress and compile reports to feed back to his father in weekly meetings. I was also very aware that the student herself was unhappy about her parent's interference, and so I had to mentor her through the process, again considering her health and wellbeing, but also responsible for making sure that she achieved the highest results she could. Her father was very pleased with the way the situation was handled, the student learned to take charge of her own progress, and she went on to get a place at the university of her choice.

            <li>
                In the first school I worked, I was asked to direct a school play. I had to audition over a hundred children, schedule and run rehearsals, design a set, and take charge of a team of teachers running different departments (lighting, sound, costume and so on), whilst still teaching a full timetable with GCSE and A Level classes. The process took three months, seven extra hours a week, and a great deal of careful management of staff, each with their own workload, as well as looking after a huge cast of 11 - 13 year olds and encouraging them to perform Shakespeare. I approached the task with commitment, determined to give the pupils the best experience of theatre and teamwork that I could, and learned to delegate rather than micromanage, setting goals of enjoyment and achievement over technique, which empowered the sixth-form assistant directors, growing their skills, too. The show was a success.
